## A Portfolio page for my personal use

- It is hosted in [https://vinaya-krishna.github.io/index](https://vinaya-krishna.github.io/index)

- I have provided a login page from where admin can login to view the messages sent to him from the index page.[https://vinaya-krishna.github.io/login](https://vinaya-krishna.github.io/login)

Here I am using a already existing back-end server.
- On Clicking Send Message in [Index Page](https://vinaya-krishna.github.io/index)(Portfolio), Message is sent to server(Currently I have disabled this feature). 
- Received messages can be viewed by loging into the [login page](https://vinaya-krishna.github.io/login), Which will redirect into [Messages](https://vinaya-krishna.github.io/messages) page.

There are some issues , I will be resolving it whenever I get time.
- [] Fix Reply in Messages page
- [ ] If user tries to open Messages page directly redirect to login page.
- [ ] Build my own backend server and host the app in heroku.
